# Udacity cs344 : Intro to parallel programming

What I learned:
- Learned the fundamentals of parallel computing with the GPU and the CUDA programming environment!
- Coded a series of image processing algorithms (which was used in Photoshop and Instragram) on high-end GPUs.

# [Lesson 1 : GPU Programming model](lesson1.md)

### Project 1 : color image -> grayscale (by using MAP)

# [Lesson 2: GPU Hardware and Parallel Communication](lesson2.md)

### Project 2: Smart Blurring (miracle product for removing wrinkles!)

# Lesson 3: Fundamental Parallel Algorithms

### Project 3: HDR Tonemapping (when 1000:1 contrast is not enough!)

# Lesson 4: Using Sort and Scan

### Project 4: Red Eye Removal (soothing relief for bright red eyes)

# Lesson 5: Optimizing GPU Programs

### Project 5: Accelerating Histograms (when fast isn't fast enough)

# Lesson 6: Parallel Computing Patterns

### Project 6: Seamless Image Compositing (polar bear in the swimming pool)

# Lesson 7: The Frontiers and Future of GPU Computing
